# Introduction

Welcome to the <a href="https://hiptest.net">Hiptest</a> API! You can use our API to access Hiptest API endpoints, which can get information on your projects in our database.

Since we don't provide integration with any programming languages (yet!), the example are written in shell, using the curl command.

Our API documentation was created with [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate).
