# Test execution

## Getting started with test executions

Test execution results in CucumberStudio are organized in the following way:

* Test execution results are grouped into builds
* Each build belongs to an execution environment
* A test run can contain multiple execution environments, each containing their own builds of test execution results.

**The notion of execution environments is entirely optional.**
You can use them if you have several environments on which you want to execute your tests.
If you do not wish to have specific environments, you can ignore them and work directly with builds at test run level.

<aside class="notice">
If no environment is specified, test runs will always have a default environment in which all builds are created.
At any moment it is possible to start working with multiple environments
by <a href="#create-a-new-execution-environment">creating new ones</a>.
All existing builds will still exist in the first, default execution environment.
</aside>

The [Builds section](#builds) specifies all operations that can be performed without execution environments.

The [Execution environments section](#execution-environments) specifies how to work with multiple environments.

Each entry in the Builds section has a warning if an execution environment ID is mandatory
when working with multiple environments.

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
project_id | The ID of the project you want to retrieve the tests from
test_run_id | The ID of the test run that contains the test you want
test_snapshot_id | The ID of the test whose you want add a test result to

### Mandatory fields

Field | Description

status | (String) The result of the test execution. Possible values are 'passed', 'failed', 'wip', 'retest', 'blocked', 'skipped', 'undefined'.
status-author | (String) The name of the author of the test execution
description | (String) A comment about the test execution

<aside class="notice">
If the provided 'status' value does not match any of the listed possible values, the result will be set as 'undefined'
</aside>

### Optional fields

Field | Description
--------- | -----------
build | (JSONAPI Relationship) The build containing your test execution result
execution_environment | (JSONAPI Relationship) The execution environment containing your test execution result

If a build is provided, the test result will be created into that build.

If an execution environment is provided, the test result will be created into the current build of that execution environment

<aside class="warning">
Providing an execution environment is not needed if a build is already specified, and will return an error if it does not belong to that environment.

project_id | The ID of the project you want to retrieve the tests from
test_run_id | The ID of the test run that contains the test you want
test_snapshot_id | The ID of the test whose you want to update a test result to
test_result_id | The ID of the test result you want to update

Field | Description
--------- | -----------
status | (String) The status of the test execution. Possible values are 'passed', 'failed', 'wip', 'retest', 'blocked', 'skipped', 'undefined'.
status-author | (String) The name of the author of the test execution
