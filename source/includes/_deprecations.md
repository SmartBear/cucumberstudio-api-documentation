# Deprecations

## Test status
Thanks to the new execution environments feature, a test is from now on executed on an execution environment.
Consequently the status attribute of a test does not mean anything without an execution environment.

To get test execution status see [Get test execution results of the current build of an execution environment](#get-test-execution-results-of-the-current-build-of-an-execution-environment)

Note that the __status__ attribute will be removed on __28 february 2020__.
