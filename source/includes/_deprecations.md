# Deprecations

## Test status
Thanks to the new execution environment feature, a test is now executed on an execution environment.
Consequently the status attribute of a test does not mean anything without an execution environment.

To get a test execution status, please refer [Get test execution results of the current build of an execution environment](#get-test-execution-results-of-the-current-build-of-an-execution-environment)

Note that the __status__ attribute will be removed on __28 february 2020__.
